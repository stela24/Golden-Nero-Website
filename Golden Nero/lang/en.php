    'art1-text' => '<p><b>What is Black Angus:</b> Angus is a breed of cattle that was specifically breed from the indigenous cattle of Scotland by Hugh Watson in the mid-nineteenth century. It 				is believed that nearly all the Black Angus cattle alive today came from the results of his attempts to maximize the black hide of these animals.</p>

        			<p><b>What`s so Great About Angus:</b> Angus beef develops with better marbling than most cattle. Marbling is the amount of intramuscular fat. Most people agree that marbling improves flavor, tenderness, and keeps meat moist while cooking (especially at high temperatures). </p>

        			<p>In Golden Nero we believe that the high quality beef is the one that everybody deserves. That’s why we build our own farm in the North West Balkans of Bulgaria. The cattle that is being raised there grows in free environment and obtains an international acknowledged certificate of quality. The farm is realized and controlled by the european funds.</p>
                    <p>Enjoy the unique taste, served in dainty and pleasing the senses way by our cooks.</p>',

    'art2-title' => 'Something about wine, Sting and Golden Nero',
    'art2-text' => '<p>Many people know British pop star Sting, but not so many know about how in love he is with Italy. </p>

                    <p>Upon a visit to Tuscany in the late 1990’s, he fell in love with Il Palagio, a 16th century estate some 24 km of Florence. Sting purchased the property and set out to renovate and expand.</p>

                    <p>With his and his wife strong environmental commitment, they had a growing desire to become farmers, and to nourish their family with genuine quality products from a healthy environment that are all 100% organic. They produce honey, jams, salami and of course wine - on the 900 acre estate.</p>

                    <div class="text-center" style="margin: 20px 0;">
                        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/om4TYr5RpvY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                    </div>

                    <p>This is how it came to the bust red wine made by Sting on his Tuscan estate. It quickly has been named as one of Italy’s finest 100 wines, placing him alongside centuries-old aristocratic winemaking dynasties such as the Frescobaldi and Antinori. The wine, named Sister Moon after one of his songs, has been acclaimed by the organizers of OperaWine, a prestigious wine fair held in Verona this past April. Experts describe it as silky and smooth, with mature tannins and hints of chocolate, liquorice and blackberries. Sister Moon is a blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, has an alcohol content of 14.9 percent and was matured for two years in French oak barrels.</p>

                    <p>Golden Nero is the only one restaurant in Bulgaria which offers this unique wine full of aroma and music. Come and enjoy it with friends!</p>',

    'art3-title' => 'Raw desserts - piece of healthy delight',
    'art3-text' => '<p>The raw food diet is not another “diet” or “regimen of diet”. Actually the whole philosophy of this eating style excludes any self- limitation with the purpose of 					starving but quite the opposite - promotes eating more real foods in their natural state.</p>

                    <p>A raw food diet is about eating mostly or all unprocessed and uncooked foods so you get all the nutrients without the dangerous additives.</p> 

                    <p>What are the health advantages of some raw products?</p>

                    <p><b>-   Nuts </b></p>

                    <p>Nuts are the nature way of proving that the healthiest products are in small size. Those energy bombs full of proteins, vitamins and minerals are powerful enough to fight the stress and strengthen the immune system.</p>

                    <p><b>-   Coconut oil</b></p>

                    <p>Despite in the natural cosmetic industry used as a strong hydrating product for skin and hair, the coconut oil is also used in the food production. Unrefined it improves the insulin levels and the good cholesterol.</p>

                    <p><b>-   Dates</b></p>

                    <p>Dates are one of the secret ingredients of many healers for slowing down the aging, as a protection of the liver from toxins and prevention of cancer.</p>

                    <p><b>-   Fruits</b></p>

                    <p>They are a proven source of minerals, fibers and vitamin C which help the immune system fight all kinds of viruses.</p>

                    <p><b>-   Coco</b></p>

                    <p>Back in the antiquity people found out about the “wakening” effect of the coco. Accountable for this are anandamide - creating the “bliss” feeling and dopamine - increasing the motivation and pleasure.</p>

                    <p><b>-   Avocado</b></p>

                    <p>The avocado is known as one of the most powerful superfoods. It has a variety of health benefits for the heart and skin and also helps keeping healthy weight.</p>

                    <p>Are you ready to embrace the raw diet revolution which spreads around the world? Golden Nero takes the healthy lifestyle as a mission that’s why we offer a variety of desserts with only natural ingredients without any heat treatment. Enjoy the irresistible and healthy taste of our sweet temptations. </p>',
